> MicroPD (<https://www.primerbanks.com/>) is the largest dedicated PCR-primer resource for microbial detection, offering more than 33,600,000 rigorously evaluated primer pairs that target 10,309,494 functional genes across 36,461 bacterial, 10,430 viral and 342 fungal genomes.  
> By focusing on functional genes (rather than traditional 16S rRNA or ITS regions), MicroPD achieves strain-level specificity and heightened sensitivity in complex mixed samples.  
> Each primer pair record supplies forward and reverse sequences, amplicon details, product size, GC content, melting temperature and complete taxonomic metadata, all navigable through a smart, taxonomy-driven search interface.  
> This comprehensive platform accelerates rapid pathogen identification, advances studies of microbial pathogenicity and strengthens surveillance and control of infectious diseases.
